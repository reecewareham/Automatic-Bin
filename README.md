# Automatic-Bin

The automatic bin is a project that was made as part of my Robotics Assignment 2 Module. It consists of a bin that uses an Arduino Uno, servos, ultrasonic sensors, RTC module and LCD screen
to create an automatic bin which tells the user when the bin is getting full and when it is bin day.

# How to Install

1. Download the files from the GitHub repository.
2. Create a sketch folder called "Automatic Bin" in your Arduino IDE sketch folder.
3. Place the Automatic Bin.ino into the folder.
4. Open the sketch in Arduino IDE.
5. Import the DS3231 library from the repository in the Arduino IDE.
6. After all the previous steps are complete, the .ino should work correctly.

# Video Demonstration
